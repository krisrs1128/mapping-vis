This workshop explores the role of visualization in data science workflows that
use satellite imagery. We'll get hands-on experience with how visualization can
be used to support,

* Data validation and cleaning
* Model inspection and error analysis.

We'll walk through a toy version of a glacier mapping problem. Using freely
available Landsat imagery, we'll train a model to recognize different types of
glaciers.

## Prerequisites
